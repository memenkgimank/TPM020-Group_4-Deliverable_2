A WiFi range extender is an internet device that only expands the WiFi signal coverage, but can't boost the speed of your original router or hold the same speed as the original router. 2. Differences between 2.4GHz and 5GHz. The differences between them are penetration and speed. 2.4GHz: penetration is good, the transmission distance is much longer than 5GHZ; 5GHz: the speed is faster than 2.4GHz, but the penetration is not better than 2.4GHz, the speed will be cut to half if there are barriers such as walls between the extender and devices. 3.How far does it extend? The extender can cover about 1292 sq. ft(36 ft range) with 360-degree full coverage. However, the range would be variable due to diverse conditions. To achieve the best performance, please locate the repeater in the middle of the router and the dead zone you want to eliminate. 4. Can I use more than one extender to extend the wifi signal even further? Rock Space WiFi extender supports signal re-extender. You could use two extenders of the same models_which are both 750mbps or 1200mbps_ to extend your WiFi signal even further. Please ensure that every antenna is paralleled with each other to make the extender works best for you.""]",,,,,,,

TL-R470T+ integrates multiple load balancing strategies, advanced QoS, and strong firewall to provide you with consistent network uptime and reliable Ethernet connectivity. Moreover, it is easy to manage the TL-R470T+ via a web-based utility, which makes building and managing your network more convenient.  Key Features Three Changeable WAN/LAN Ports The TL-R470T+ features three changeable ports that can be set to either LAN or WAN, allowing the router to support up to four WAN ports to satisfy various Internet access requirements through one device. The router also has an integrated smart load balancing function which automatically selects the most efficient line according to load and bandwidth requirements, providing users with consistent network uptime and reliable Ethernet connectivity.  Abundant Security Features For defense against external threats, TL-R470T+ can automatically detect and block Denial of service (DoS) attacks such as TCP/UDP/ICMP Flooding, Ping of Death and other related threats. Moreover, this router provides IP/MAC/URL/WEB \xadfiltering functions, which forcefully prevent attacks from intruders and viruses. For applications such as FTP, H.323, SIP, IPsec and PPTP which are not well compatible with NAT, TL-R470T+ offers administrators one-click enable of ALG choices corresponding to the above five applications. Efficient Access Management By setting up a PPPoE Server to allocate PPPoE accounts to private network users, the router only allows users with legal accounts that have passed authentication to access the Internet. With IP-based Bandwidth Control, the router is capable of confining bandwidth usage of certain PPPoE accounts. Moreover, the E-Bulletin function is able to release a bulletin in the form of webpage to certain user groups periodically, which notifies the users about the expiration date of the PPPoE account. With the above features, the router will prioritize different users in surfer jurisdictions for more efficient management. Safety-Minded Enterprise Investments Professional lightning protection technology is designed to prevent electrical surges from penetrating the interior of the device. This router is designed to prevent lightning damage of up to 4KV in the well-grounded connection conditions.

External antennas provide better Wi-Fi coverage and higher speed, while the convenient wall-plug design saves space. It works with any standard Wi-Fi router & is ideal for keeping your mobile devices connected as you move throughout your home. The extender works like a bridge between a WiFi router (or a WiFi access point) and a WiFi device outside the range of the WiFi router. The extender performs two main jobs:The extender connects to a working WiFi network. When the extender connects over WiFi to an existing network, it functions as a network client, similar to how a WiFi device connects to a network. The extender acts as an access point for WiFi devices. We recommend that you connect through the extender network only when the WiFi device is in a “dead zone” where connection from the existing network is poor or nonexistent. Data traffic routed through the extender is inherently slower than traffic routed directly from the network.
